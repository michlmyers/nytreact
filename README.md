## NY Times article fetch app

This app was created mid-July, 2018. 

The purpose of the app is to search the NY Times article database by topic and display a list of articles that relate to the searched topic. 

The article details I am pulling and displaying are the title, published date, and url. 

You can then click to save any of the article details from the search results. 

Once saved the app will render any saved articles in a separate section of the page. 

You can click on the URL of any of the articles to read them and you can click to delete any articles from your saved section. 

# Technologies

For the construction of this app I'm using React on the client side with Node and Express on the server side. The database which article information is being saved to is MongoDB. This app is also deployed through Heroku. 

# Future Development

I'd like to spend some more time with the style. I'd also like to rebuild the app and manage state using Redux. Perhaps that will happen in the next version of this.
